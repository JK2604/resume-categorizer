# New Plan!

## So far
1. Install poppler (for pdf2image)
2. Install python library pdf2image (https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image)
- Needed because pytesseract accepts images
3. Install tesseract (for pytesseract)
4. Install python library pillow (for pytesseract)
5. Install python library pytesseract

## General Plan
- Need to have solution ready to be used by user with few commands
- Dockerize!
